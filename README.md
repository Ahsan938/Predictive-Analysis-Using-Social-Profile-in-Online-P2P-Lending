# Predictive-Analysis-Using-Social-Profile-in-Online-P2P-Lending
Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending enables individuals to obtain loans directly from other individuals, cutting out the financial institution as the middleman.The project's objective is to leverage real-world data from Prosper to analyze and visualize the factors influencing variations in loan interest rates across diverse borrower groups within this emerging alternative financial service.

Prosper was founded in 2005 as the first peer-to-peer lending marketplace in the United States. Since then, Prosper has facilitated more than $23 billion in loans to more than 1,400,000 people. Through Prosper, people can invest in each other in a way that is financially and socially rewarding. Borrowers apply online for a fixed-rate, fixed-term loan. Individuals and institutions can invest in the loans and earn attractive return.
